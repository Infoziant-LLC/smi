                  If you want to visit the UAE without a sponsor, these options are available for you.

                <p>
                  Since some nations can obtain a visa upon arrival, you must determine whether you need to submit a
                  request for a visit visa prior to making travel arrangements to the UAE. Here are all of your visa
                  options if you want to go on vacation in the UAE.
                </p>

                <h3 class="gradientText">Transit Visa – for 48 or 96 hours</h3>

                <p>
                  This is a type of visit visa in UAE. People can send a request for a 48-hour or 96-hour transit visa
                  if they have a quick layover at a local airport. The airline you are flying with in the UAE or a
                  travel agent could help you obtain the visa. However, transit visas are neither renewable or
                  extendable, and you must depart the UAE within 48 or 96 hours of your arrival.
                </p>
                <p>
                  UAE transit visas come in two types of visa in UAE, and each has a distinct term. So, if you have a
                  transit visa for Dubai issued on arrival, you must determine how long you can stay there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="fw-bold">48-Hour Visit Visa</span>
                  <span>If you are passing via the airports of the UAE, this sort of visa is free. But you must submit a
                    request in advance to get it. You have 48 hours from the time you enter the UAE to leave. If not,
                    you can be subject to legal repercussions.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                  <span class="fw-bold">96-Hour Visit Visa</span>
                  <span>You must spend AED 50 to receive this transit visa, which is necessary for entry into Dubai. You
                    must submit an application in advance, therefore, make sure everything is prepared before you come.
                    You have 96 hours from the time of entry till you depart the nation because it is neither extendable
                    nor renewed.</span>
                </p>

                <h6>
                  The necessary documents for this type of visa in UAE include:
                </h6>

                <ul>
                  <li>Valid passport.</li>
                  <li>Headshot picture.</li>
                  <li>Flight ticket for travel.</li>
                  <li>A hotel reservation in the region.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Before departing, you must apply for a UAE transit visa. However, just like with other types of visas
                  in UAE, you need a sponsor who can submit an application for you at a UAE consulate or embassy abroad.
                </p>
